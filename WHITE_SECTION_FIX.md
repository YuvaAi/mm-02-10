# White Section Fix - Content Preview in Dark Mode

## Issue Identified
The generated content preview sections were showing white backgrounds in dark mode, making them stand out inappropriately against the dark theme. This included:
- Content preview section
- Generated caption section  
- Hashtags section
- Final post section
- Uploaded media preview

## Root Cause
The `ContentPreviewAndPublish.tsx` component was using inconsistent styling:
- Some sections used `bg-bg-alt` which doesn't have proper dark mode support
- Some sections used `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800` but the dark mode wasn't working properly
- Text colors were using semantic classes that weren't properly defined for dark mode

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ContentPreviewAndPublish.tsx

**Updated All Content Sections:**

#### âœ… Content Preview Section
- **Before**: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800` (not working)
- **After**: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-700` with proper borders
- **Text**: `text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100` for main content
- **Word Count**: `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400` for secondary text

#### âœ… Generated Caption Section  
- **Before**: `bg-bg-alt` (inconsistent)
- **After**: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-700` with consistent styling
- **Text**: `text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100`

#### âœ… Hashtags Section

#### âœ… Uploaded Media Section
- **Before**: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800` with `bg-bg-alt` inner elements
- **After**: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-700` with `bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-600` inner elements
- **Text**: `text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200`

#### âœ… Generated Image Section
- **Before**: Title using `text-text` only
- **After**: Title using `text-text dark:text-gray-100`

### 2. Consistent Styling Applied

**All Content Sections Now Use:**
- **Container**: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-700`
- **Border**: `border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-600`
